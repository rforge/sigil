* SIGIL Course

** Unit #3
- show Anscombe's quartet as a warning on trusting summary statistics
  - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet
  - included in base R as data set =anscombe=
  - we haven't talked about correlation measures yet, but include as a preview

** Unit #8
- redo illustration plots for passives example
  - R code already imported into SVN, revise as necessary
- re-structure and improve discussion of non-randomness
- develop exercise using the passives data (or perhaps noun frequencies)
  - LM / GLM regression
  - either include register/dsm predictors in SIGIL package
  - or use data set from BNC with more comprehensive metadata

* SIGIL Package
- TODO

* corpora Package
- re-think purpose and structure of =corpora= package
- avoid duplication of =BNCmeta= data set in =SIGIL= and =corpora=
