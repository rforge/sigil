\subsection{Tasks for \texttt{corpora} package}
\label{sec:tasks-corpora}

\begin{itemize}
\item Change implementation of p-values and confidence intervals to use ``central'' method \citep[$p_c$, cf.][]{Fay:10a}, which is efficient and consistent.  Explain in help pages why this is a sensible choice for corpus linguistics (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Fay2010}).
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tasks for SIGIL slides}
\label{sec:tasks-sigil}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mention different types of two-sided p-values and confidence intervals, which can lead to inconsistencies, with example from \citet{Fay:10a}.  Recommendation for corpus linguistics: conservative central p-values $p_c$ and matching confidence intervals, implemented in \texttt{corpora} package.  Note that most standard implementations (e.g.\ \texttt{fisher.test} and \texttt{binom.test} in R) calculate minlike p-values $p_m$ that will often differ from $p_c$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\citet{Fay:10,Fay:10a}: Exact confidence intervals for two-sided tests}
\label{sec:Fay2010}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notation: test statistic $T$ for parameter $\theta$ with observed value $t$; $f_{\theta}(t) = \pC{T=t}{\theta}$ is the likelihood; $F_{\theta}(t) = \pC{T\leq t}{\theta}$ and $\bar{F}_{\theta}(t) = \pC{T\geq t}{\theta}$ are the lower/upper tail probabilities
\item My notaton: $G_{\theta}(t) = \min\set{F_{\theta}(t), \bar{F}_{\theta}(t)}$ for the ``appropriate'' tail probability
\item Exact two-sided p-values for discrete data can be defined in different ways. \citet{Fay:10a} lists three important and widely-used methods:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{central} p-value: $p_c = 2\cdot G_{\theta}(t)$, clamped to $[0,1]$ (aka.\ TST = twice the smaller tail); usually easy to compute and well-behaved (monotonic in $\theta$, cf.\ Fig.~1 on p.~56); exact confidence intervals are often based on $p_c$
  \item \textbf{minlike} p-value: $p_m = \sum_{f(s)\leq f(t)} f_{\theta}(s)$; implementations of exact tests often report $p_m$ as two-sided p-value; not always well-behaved and confidence sets may have ``holes''
  \item \textbf{blaker} p-value: $p_b$ is the appropriate tail probability $G_{\theta}(t)$ plus the largest opposite tail that does not exceed $G_{\theta}(t)$ (aka.\ CT = combined tails method); \citet{Blaker:00}\todo{get copy of \citet{Blaker:00} and update details in bibtex database} presents a comprehensive analysis of this method and derives improved confidence intervals
  \end{enumerate}
\item \citet{Fay:10a} gives an excellent concise overview of two-sided p-values and confidence intervals for $2\times 2$ tables using the three methods above, with examples of inconsistencies arising if different methods are mixed (typically central confidence interval with minlike p-value)
\item All three methods and Matching confidence intervals developed by \citet{Fay:10}\todo{read \citet{Fay:10} and add notes} are implemented in the R packages \textbf{exact2x2} and \textbf{exactci}; in some cases, inconsistencies cannot be entirely avoided because ``true'' confidence sets aren't connected intervals (Fig.~3, p.~57)
\item Conclusion: central p-value $p_c$ is easy to compute, well-behaved (Fig.~1) and consistent confidence intervals can be determined efficiently; in most cases (though not always) it is more conservative than the other methods (i.e.\ $p_c > p_m, p_b$).  Therefore it makes sense to \textbf{use central p-values} and the matching confidence intervals in \textbf{corpus linguistics}
\end{itemize}
