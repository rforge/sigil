	Abstract = {This article is a survey of methods for measuring agreement among corpus annotators. It exposes the mathematics and underlying assumptions of agreement coefficients, covering Krippendorff's alpha as well as Scott's pi and Cohen's kappa; discusses the use of coefficients in several annotation tasks; and argues that weighted, alpha-like coefficients, traditionally less used than kappa-like measures in computational linguistics, may be more appropriate for many corpus annotation tasks---but that their use makes the interpretation of the value of the coefficient even harder.

POS-Tagging: observed agreement of 98.57% between annotators (on 147k tokens), no kappa values given.  Final consensus annotation after ``discussions and several iterations of cleaning'' has 98.8% agreement with each annotator (before discussion).  My conclusion: accuracy above 98.5% cannot be expected from automatic POS tagger and will probably reflect overtraining on remaining errors in gold standard.

Syntactic annotation: F-score for matching constituents between annotators are around 93% (labelled and unlabelled are close together, but down to 88.5% when edge labels are taken into account).  Final annotation has 95%-96% F-score compared to individual annotators.}}

	Year = {1994},
	Abstract = {Although the kappa statistic is widely used in measuring interrater agreement, it is known that the standard confidence interval estimation behaves poorly in small samples and for nonzero kappas. Efforts have been made to improve the estimation through transformation and Edgeworth expansion (Flack 1987). The results remain unsatisfactory when kappa is far from 0, however, even with the sample size as large as 100. In this article we reparameterize the kappa statistic to reveal its relationship with the marginal probability of agreement. The reparameterization not only gives a more meaningful interpretation of kappa but also clearly demonstrates that the range of kappa depends on the marginal probabilities. Various two- and three-dimensional plots are shown to illustrate the relationship among these parameters. The immediate application is to construct a new confidence interval based on the profile variance and reparameterization. Extensive simulation studies show that the new confidence interval performs very well in almost all parameter settings even when other methods fail.}}
