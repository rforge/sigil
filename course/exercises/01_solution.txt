## Our solution to Exercise #1 (analysing the BNC metadata)
## 

# TIMTOWTDI ;-)

## load the "corpora" package and attach the BNC metadata table

library(corpora)
nrow(BNCmeta)   # check that we can access the data
attach(BNCmeta)


## question 1

dim(BNCmeta)

# how many metadata? it depends on how you define metadata, but if you
# consider each column, id's included, to be metadata, then the number of
# metadata is the same as the number of columns, i.e., 31

?BNCmeta # to display the help page, with brief explanations of variables

## question 2

# how many genres
length(levels(genre))
# you could also use length(summary(genre)) or length(table(genre))

# the smallest ones
head(sort(table(genre)))


## question 3

# on a German Windows PC, you have to use write.csv2(), because
# Excel expects a different CSV format there; otherwise use write.csv()
write.csv2(BNCmeta,"bncmeta.csv",row.names=FALSE)


## question 4

# summarise the distribution of text lengths

summary(n_w)
summary(n_s)

# outliers in written-to-be-spoken

boxplot(n_words[text_type=="written-to-be-spoken"])
boxplot(n_words[text_type=="written-to-be-spoken"])$out

# can you list the titles of the outlier texts?
# (threshold of 20000 obtained visually from box plot)
title[ text_type == "written-to-be-spoken" & n_words <= 20000 ]


## question 5

# do text lengths differ between text types?

boxplot(n_words ~ text_type, ylim=c(0,100000))

# do they differ between male and female authors?

boxplot(n_words ~ author_sex, ylim=c(0,1e+05))

# or

boxplot(n_words[author_sex=="male"], n_words[author_sex=="female"], names=c("male","female"))


## question 6

# produce a subset of the metadata table containing only texts
# for which author sex is known...

temp <- subset(BNCmeta, author_sex=="male" | author_sex=="female")

# ... omitting the title and irrelevant metadata columns (esp. 
# those which have only a single value in the subset)...

# let's check which columns have this property:
summary(temp)

# they appear to be:
# context interaction_type mode region respondent_age respondent_class respondent_sex

# subsetting:
male.female <- subset(temp, select=-c(title, context, interaction_type, mode, region, respondent_age, respondent_class, respondent_sex))

## question 7

plot(n_words, n_s, xlim=c(0,100000), ylim=c(0,10000))
cor.test(n_words, n_s)
# corr coeff: 0.8687635
# conf intervals: 0.8610003; 0.8761220 

# relation does not appear to be linear: plot strongly
# suggests that different sets of documents follow
# different patterns, some linerar, some not
