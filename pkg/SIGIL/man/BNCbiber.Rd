\title{

  Biber's (1988) register features for the British National Corpus

}

\description{

  This data set contains a table of the relative frequencies (per 1000 words)
  of 65 linguistic features (Biber 1988, 1995) for each text document in the
  British National Corpus (Aston & Burnard 1998).
  
  Biber (1988) introduced these features for the purpose of a multidimensional
  register analysis. Variables in the data set are numbered according to Biber's
  list (see e.g. Biber 1995, 95f).
  
  Feature frequencies were automatically extracted from the British National Corpus
  using query patterns based on part-of-speech tags (Gasthaus 2007).  Note that
  features 60 and 65 had to be omitted because they cannot be identified
  with sufficient accuracy by the automatic methods.  For further information on
  the extraction methodology, see Gasthaus (2007, 20-21).  The original data set
  and the Python scripts used for feature extraction are available from
  \url{http://cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~CL/download/BSc_Gasthaus2007/}; the
  version included here contains some bug fixes.

\usage{
data(BNCbiber)
}

\format{

  A numeric matrix with 4048 rows and 65 columns, specifying the relative frequencies
  (per 1000 words) of 65 linguistic features.  Documents are listed in the same order
  as the metadata in \code{\link{BNCmeta}} and rows are labelled with text IDs, so it
  is straightforward to combine the two data sets.
